    My baby you make me live in candy paradise. The way ypu treat me and care for me always make me blush and be more in love with you. I still can feel the butterfly in my stomach since the first day I love you.
    I'm grateful we are together, I wouldn't risk losing you.
    So telling me to break up with you is pointless and stupid because you are my happiness. Please never tell me to break up with you anymore.

    <p style="color: #ebd9fc;">Volume up!!!</p>
